Project Description

FitCheck.AI is your personal, brutally honest, AI-powered fashion consultant. It analyzes your outfit in real-time, providing style ratings, suggestions, and even a little bit of sass. Upload a photo, and get instant feedback on whether your "fit" is a "hit" or a "miss."

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

In an increasingly casual world, people have forgotten the art of dressing to impress. Our society is on the brink of a fashion crisis, with mismatched socks and questionable color combinations running rampant. The world needs a solution to prevent global embarrassment, one outfit at a time.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

FitCheck.AI provides a highly sophisticated, AI-driven platform to judge your sartorial choices. Using advanced computer vision and a database of fashion no-nos, it will give you a style rating from 1 to 10 (with 10 being "you're a style icon" and 1 being "did you get dressed in the dark?"). It also offers constructive, albeit sometimes snarky, suggestions for improvement.
